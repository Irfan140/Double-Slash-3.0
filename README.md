# 🌱 Carbon Footprint Predictor  

## 🚀 About the Project  
This project was developed by **Team The Scouts** during a hackathon under the **Green Tech** theme. Our goal is to help individuals estimate their **carbon footprint** based on their lifestyle choices, encouraging sustainable living.  

## 🎯 Mission  
To empower individuals with data-driven insights into their **carbon footprint**, promoting sustainable habits and responsible living.  

## 👁️ Vision  
A future where every individual is aware of their environmental impact and takes conscious steps toward a **greener planet**.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
With rising environmental concerns, many people are unaware of their individual contribution to carbon emissions. Our **web application** provides insights into one's carbon footprint, allowing users to make more informed decisions for a sustainable future.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
- **Dataset**: Kaggle (10,000 data points)  
- **Accuracy (R² Score)**: **0.89**  

## 🔍 Features  
✅ Predicts an individual's carbon footprint based on lifestyle inputs  
✅ User-friendly web interface for easy interaction  
✅ Flask API processes user inputs and returns predictions  
✅ Machine learning model trained on real-world data  
✅ Encourages users to adopt eco-friendly habits  

## 📊 SWOT Analysis  

### ✅ Strengths  
- High prediction accuracy (**R² = 0.89**)  
- Covers multiple real-world factors influencing carbon footprint  
- User-friendly and accessible via a web application  
- Uses an efficient machine learning model (SVR)  

### ❌ Weaknesses  
- Requires internet access to function  
- Predictions are based on predefined data and may not cover unique cases  
- Some features may be subjective (e.g., diet habits)  

### 🔥 Opportunities  
- Can be expanded to include **real-time carbon tracking**  
- Could integrate **carbon offset suggestions** for users  
- Potential for **collaborations with sustainability organizations**  

### ⚠️ Threats  
- Availability of more advanced prediction models in the future  
- Need for regular dataset updates to maintain accuracy  
- User privacy concerns regarding input data
